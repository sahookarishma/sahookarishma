## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Karishma Sahoo, a final-year PhD scholar in **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology** at VIT, India. My research focuses on developing and applying computational methods to understand the epigenetic regulation of cancer, particularly through **DNA methylation** analysis.

- ðŸ”¬ Iâ€™m currently working on:  
  Integrative analysis of **DNA methylation, transcriptomics, scRNA-seq**, and clinical data to identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in **colorectal cancer**.

- ðŸ§  My research interests include:  
  - Cancer Epigenomics  
  - Multi-omics Data Integration  
  - Machine Learning & Network-based Biomarker Discovery  
  - Translational Bioinformatics  
  - Computational Pathology

- ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies:  
  Python | R | Bioconductor | scikit-learn | PyTorch | TensorFlow | Keras | Git | Linux

- ðŸ’» Deep Learning Projects:  
  - Built and trained **CNN models using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras** for cancer image classification tasks.  
  - Applied **transfer learning (AlexNet, VGG)** to histopathological image datasets for binary and multi-class cancer classification.  
  - Worked on **self-supervised and supervised learning** frameworks for biomarker prediction and survival risk modeling.  
  - Developed custom **data preprocessing pipelines** and augmentation strategies for histology image analysis.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:  
  DNA methylation analysis, deep learning in biomedical research, ChAMP pipeline, differential methylation, biomarker discovery, and bioinformatics workflows.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:  
  Computational projects in **cancer biology**, **digital pathology**, **multi-omics**, and **precision medicine**.

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning:  
  Advanced **multi-omics integration**, **graph neural networks (GNNs)**, and **interpretable AI** for cancer prediction.
